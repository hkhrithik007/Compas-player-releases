# Compas v1.0.1

A stability update for Compas v1.0.

- **Optional QWERTY keyboard:** choose T9 or QWERTY in **Settings > Display > Appearance > Keyboard**, with accented letters and symbols. T9 remains the default.
- Reduce possible reboots during long MP3 processing and waveform generation by moving large scratch buffers off worker stacks and sizing decoder threads explicitly.
- Stop checking writable SD cards solely because their FAT dirty flag is set, avoiding unnecessary startup repair loops on small cards. Interrupted checks are guarded against repeated attempts.
- Reduce memory spikes when starting helper processes, and save persistent crash and player-exit diagnostics for unexpected restarts.
- Support versioned firmware releases while retaining compatibility with dated OTA releases. This update prepares the player for version-only releases starting with v1.1.

# Compas v1.0

A refreshed player experience, from first setup to Now Playing.

## Highlights

- **Downloadable player layouts:** browse picture cards and install **Gallery, Panorama, Vinyl, Orbit, Hiby's, or Hiby's Graph** from **Settings > Display > Player Layout > Layout > Download**. Tap the cover for lyrics in every layout.
- **New Car Mode options:** a dedicated volume applied when Car Mode is enabled, a drawer quick toggle with long-press access to settings, **Low/High gain** when the Gain plugin is installed, and optional **Auto-resume** on external-power startup with headphones connected.
- **Welcome & Quick Setup:** a musical welcome animation followed by language, time zone, Wi-Fi, plugins, layout selection, and library scanning. Selected plugins and layouts install together at the end, with progress and one retry for failures.
- **Revised themes:** improved Home screen layouts and eight new looks through the **Themes** plugin, including Porcelain, Arctic Glass, Cherry Noir, and Citrus Slate.
- **Better Plugin Store:** descriptions from the live catalog, clearer install/update controls, and a separate gallery for player layouts. Updated AutoEQ, Audiobooks, Podcasts, EPUB Reader, and Lock Screen plugins are available.
- **More languages:** English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese, including Quick Setup. Translations remain drafts awaiting native review.

## Everyday improvements

- Smoother lyrics, drawer, and power-menu transitions; clearer frosted glass, improved frame pacing, and more reliable touch handling.
- Redesigned **Parametric EQ** with larger slider touch targets, profile controls, a Flat reset, and a response graph.
- Reorganized settings, larger popup controls, consistent rows, and **Sound / Playback / Library** shortcuts in Music.
- T9 remains the default keyboard, with optional QWERTY in **Settings > Display > Appearance > Keyboard** for accented letters and symbols; numeric fields keep the numeric keypad.
- Improved library search and sorting, Genres browsing, Play All controls, Subsonic queues/downloads/quality, and safer handling of damaged tags and additional track formats.
- **LDAC in Bluetooth DAC mode is now automatic** with the rebuilt decoder; its experimental toggle is removed.
- Better Wi-Fi/Bluetooth lists, accent-color refresh, SD-card warning handling, and R3II 2025 scaling/volume-wheel behavior.

**After updating:** refresh all metadata for corrected cached tags; update the database to populate album release years. Update installed plugins through Plugin Manager to receive their latest features.
