# Player layouts

You can redesign the Now Playing screen without touching C code. A layout is
an LVGL XML file that says what the screen looks like. The app takes care of
what it does: playback, seeking, cover art, lyrics, theme colors.

If you don't install a layout, nothing changes. The built-in layout is the
default, and it is also the fallback whenever a custom one fails to load.

## Quick start

1. Copy `assets/theme2/player_layouts/example_minimal.xml` and rename it, for
   example `clean.xml`. The file name (without `.xml`) is the name shown in
   Settings.
2. Edit it. Keep the widget names listed under [Widgets the app looks
   for](#widgets-the-app-looks-for); everything else is up to you.
3. Copy it to the SD card, into `.plugins/player_layouts/`.
4. On the player, open **Settings > Display > Player Layout > Layout** and
   pick it. The interface reloads with the new layout, and the choice is
   remembered across restarts.

To go back, pick **Default** in the same list.

After editing the layout that is already active, pick another layout and then
yours again (or call `plugin.reload_ui()`) to load the new version.

## Where layout files go

The app looks for `*.xml` files in these folders. If two folders have a file
with the same name, the later one in this list wins:

| Folder | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/resource/litegui/theme2/player_layouts/` | Layouts shipped with the firmware (from `assets/theme2/player_layouts/` in this repo). |
| `/usr/data/theme_overrides/player_layouts/` | Layouts installed on the device's internal storage. |
| `<SD card>/.plugins/player_layouts/` | Layouts on the SD card. The easiest place for your own. |

On the simulator, the folders are `assets/theme2/player_layouts/` and
`./music/.plugins/player_layouts/`.

File names (without `.xml`) are 1 to 63 letters, digits, `_`, `-` or `.`,
must not start with `.`, and `default` is reserved. A file can be up to
256 KB, and the list holds up to 24 layouts including Default.

### One file per screen size

The players have different screens: R1 is 480x800, R3 Pro II is 480x720 and
R3 II 2025 is 320x480. A layout built with percentages and flex rows can fit
all of them. If it doesn't, add a version for a specific screen next to it,
named `name@WIDTHxHEIGHT.xml`:

```
clean.xml            used on every screen without its own file
clean@320x480.xml    used instead on the R3 II 2025
```

Only `clean` appears in Settings. The example layout ships with a 320x480
version you can compare with.

## Writing the XML

A layout is one LVGL XML `<component>`: optional `<consts>`, `<styles>` and
`<animations>`, plus a `<view>` holding the widgets. The format is described
in LVGL's XML documentation (`lvgl/docs/src/xml/` once the project has been
built once). Things to know:

- The app uses the **LVGL 9.4** XML engine, so follow the 9.4 docs.
- Use LVGL's own widgets (`lv_obj`, `lv_label`, `lv_image`, `lv_slider`,
  `lv_button`, `lv_bar`, `lv_arc` and so on). A layout cannot use other
  components or other XML files.
- XML cannot call app code. Interactive widgets work through the names below.
- Sizes are in pixels. Use `#screen_w`, `#screen_h`, percentages and flex
  layouts to adapt to the screen.

### Ready-made fonts, images and sizes

These names can be used directly:

- **Fonts:** `player_title` and `player_meta` (the built-in Player's title and
  artist fonts), `font_16`, `font_20`, `font_22` and `font_28` (these follow
  the Font Size setting and a custom font), and `lv_font_default`. Example:
  `style_text_font="player_title"`.
- **Images:** the Player's own icons, which also follow theme overrides:
  `default_cover`, `btn_play`, `btn_pause`, `btn_prev`, `btn_prev_s`,
  `btn_next`, `btn_next_s`, `ic_more`, `collect_out`, `collect_in`,
  `quality_waveform`, `order`, `loop`, `single`, `random`, `btn_back`.
  Example: `<lv_image src="btn_next"/>`. These names don't work for
  `bg_image_src` inside `<styles>`; use an `<lv_image>` widget there instead.
- **Sizes:** `screen_w` and `screen_h`, the screen size in pixels. Example:
  `width="#screen_w"`.

Anything you declare in your own `<consts>`, `<fonts>` or `<images>` takes
priority over these names.

## Widgets the app looks for

The app finds widgets by their `name` attribute and brings them to life. The
rest of your layout is decoration.

**Required.** Without these the layout is rejected and the default one is
used:

| Name | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cover_card` | any | Frame for the cover art. Give it a size, rounded corners, clipping. |
| `cover_img` | `lv_image` | The cover art. Put it inside `cover_card`; it is scaled to fill the card. Tapping it opens and closes lyrics. |
| `title` | `lv_label` | Song title. Scrolls when too long. |
| `play_btn` | `lv_image` | Play/pause. Its icon switches automatically and takes the accent color. |
| `progress_slider` | `lv_slider` | Seek bar. |

**Optional.** Leave out what you don't want:

| Name | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artist`, `album` | `lv_label` | Artist (or folder name) and album. Scroll when too long. Tapping opens the matching local artist or album when the playing path is in the library. |
| `pos_label`, `dur_label` | `lv_label` | Elapsed and total time. |
| `song_count` | `lv_label` | Position in the queue, for example "3/12". |
| `format_badge` | `lv_label` | Codec, bit depth and sample rate. |
| `quality_pill` | any | Container around the format badge. |
| `favorite_circle` | any | Background of the heart button. Tapping it toggles the favorite. |
| `favorite_icon` | `lv_image` | The heart. Switches between empty and full. |
| `order_btn` | `lv_image` | Play mode (in order, repeat, repeat one, shuffle). Tap to change. |
| `prev_btn`, `next_btn` | `lv_image` | Previous and next. Hold to seek. |
| `more_btn` | `lv_image` | Opens the song menu. |
| `dismiss_btn` | any | Leaves the Player, like Back. |
| `overlay_panel` | any | Full-screen surface the blurred cover background is drawn on. |
| `background_img` | `lv_image` | The blurred cover, inside `overlay_panel`. |
| `volume_slider` | `lv_slider` | Shows the volume. Display only, it can't be dragged. |

A widget with the right name but the wrong type is ignored (for a required
one, the layout is rejected).

### What you get for free

- **Theme colors.** Labels get the theme's text colors, and the slider, heart
  outline and play button get the accent color. These are applied after the
  layout's `<styles>`, so to use your own color set it directly on the widget,
  for example `style_text_color="0xFFFFFF"`.
- **Bigger touch areas.** Small buttons get an invisible touch area of at
  least 44x44 pixels around them. It is placed once, when the screen is built,
  so a timeline that moves a button doesn't move its touch area.
- **Scrolling text.** `title`, `artist` and `album` scroll when the text is
  too long. Give them a fixed width (for example `width="100%"`).
- **Artist and album taps.** Keep the `artist` and `album` labels outside the
  cover image's hit area: tapping the cover toggles lyrics, while tapping a
  metadata label opens its matching local library group. Streams and tracks
  that are not indexed locally leave these labels inert.
- **The blurred background.** If you leave out `overlay_panel` and
  `background_img`, the app adds hidden ones behind everything. To see the
  blurred cover, keep whatever sits on top of them transparent.
- **Song info for other features.** If you leave out `artist` or `album`, the
  app keeps hidden copies, so Remote Control and the quick drawer still show
  them.

## Animations and the lyrics view

Add a `<timeline>` with one of these names to animate the screen. Each one is
optional:

| Timeline | Plays when |
| --- | --- |
| `screen_enter` | the Player opens |
| `track_change` | a new song starts (after its title and artist are shown) |
| `lyrics_open` | lyrics open (tap on the cover) |
| `lyrics_close` | lyrics close |

Timelines animate style properties such as opacity, size, position offsets
(`translate`) and padding. See `ui_elements/animations.rst` in LVGL's XML
docs.

**Lyrics without timelines.** If the layout doesn't define both
`lyrics_open` and `lyrics_close`, the standard animation runs: the cover
shrinks to the top-left corner, the song info moves next to it, the controls
hide, and the lyrics fill the space below.

**Lyrics with timelines.** If both exist, your timelines move things, and the
app:

1. turns off the buttons' touch areas while lyrics are open,
2. when `lyrics_open` finishes, hides these widgets: `order_btn`, `prev_btn`,
   `play_btn`, `next_btn`, `more_btn`, `progress_slider`, `pos_label`,
   `dur_label`, `quality_pill`, `dismiss_btn` and `song_count` (except one
   that contains, or sits inside, the cover or the song info), and always
   `favorite_circle`,
3. shows the lyrics below whichever of the cover, title, artist or album ends
   lowest,
4. shows those widgets again when `lyrics_close` starts, so they can animate
   back in.

Anything else on the screen, such as decorations, is left as is: hide or fade
it in your timelines.

Tips:

- End `lyrics_close` in the layout's normal state. Leaving the Player jumps
  straight to its end.
- The cover image isn't resized while `cover_card` changes size; it is fitted
  again when the animation ends.
- The lyrics text itself (font, colors, highlighting) and the lyrics area's
  side and bottom margins are not part of the layout.

## Using a layout from a plugin

A plugin can ship a layout and offer it in Settings:

```lua
plugin.set_player_layout({ xml = "player_layouts/clean.xml", name = "Clean" })
```

The path is relative to the SD card's `.plugins` folder. Called from the
plugin's top-level code, this only adds the layout to **Settings > Display >
Player Layout > Layout**; the user picks it there and the choice is remembered
while the plugin stays installed. Called from a callback, it switches to the
layout right away, for this session only. See `plugin.set_player_layout` in
[PLUGINS.md](../PLUGINS.md) for the details. Published plugins, including ones
that ship layouts, live in the
[compas-plugins repository](https://github.com/Starnished66/compas-plugins).

## Building a layout into the firmware

Developers can compile a layout into the app instead of shipping an XML file.
LVGL's UI Editor (LVGL Pro) can export an XML component as C, which gives a
function like `lv_obj_t * my_player_create(lv_obj_t * parent);`.

1. In the editor, name the widgets as above, then export the component.
2. Copy the generated `.c` and `.h` into `src/ui/` and add the `.c` to
   `APP_SRCS` in the `Makefile`. The code must build against LVGL 9.5 in
   `lvgl/`. Fonts and icons are app objects there: use the C names, for
   example `app_font_player_title` and `asset_path("playing_plane/btn_play.png")`
   (`src/ui/player_layouts.c` lists them all).
3. Register the layout once, early in `gui_init()` and before
   `gui_player_init()`:

   ```c
   #include "player_layouts.h"
   #include "my_player.h"

   player_layouts_register_c("my_player", "My player", my_player_create);
   ```

   The first argument is the id saved in the settings, the second the name
   shown in Settings. The create function must return the root object it made,
   or NULL on failure.

4. To use timelines from exported code, register a function that returns
   them by name. It is called once per name when the screen is built, and each
   timeline must belong to `root`:

   ```c
   static lv_anim_timeline_t * my_player_timeline(lv_obj_t * root, const char * name) {
       if (strcmp(name, "track_change") == 0) return my_player_get_track_change(root);
       return NULL;
   }

   player_layouts_register_c_ex("my_player", "My player", my_player_create, my_player_timeline);
   ```

## If something goes wrong

- **The default layout shows instead of mine.** The file failed to load, or a
  required widget is missing or has the wrong type. The reason is printed to
  the app's error output (stderr). On the simulator, run it from a terminal
  to see it.
- **My layout isn't in the list.** Check the folder, the `.xml` extension, and
  that the name only uses letters, digits, `_`, `-` and `.`. Files with `@` in
  the name are screen-size versions and are not listed.
- **Part of the screen is cut off on one model.** Add a
  `name@WIDTHxHEIGHT.xml` version for that screen.
- **An attribute seems to do nothing.** LVGL ignores attributes it doesn't
  know, and in release builds it doesn't warn about them. Check the spelling
  against the 9.4 XML docs.

## Notes

- Only one XML layout is loaded at a time. Switching reloads the interface.
- The XML engine adds about 220 KB to the app. It only starts when an XML
  layout is used.
- The app sizes `background_img` to the full screen and places it at the
  top-left of its parent, so put it in a full-screen container at the
  top-left of the screen (as `overlay_panel` is in the example).
