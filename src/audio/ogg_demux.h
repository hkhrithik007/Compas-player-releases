 * playback needs: page/segment parsing, the OpusHead/OpusTags header
 * packets, and sequential audio-packet reads with a granule-position seek
 * index. Deliberately narrower than a general-purpose Ogg library (libogg):
 * a single file, a single logical audio bitstream, no chaining, no
 * multiplexed secondary streams -- this project hand-writes its container
 * demuxers (asf_demux.c/h for WMA, mp4_demux.c/h for ALAC/AAC, ape_demux.c/h
 * for APE) rather than vendoring general machinery for a comparatively
 * simple bitstream format. Page 0 of the file is assumed to be the
 * OpusHead page (required by RFC 7845 Section 3), so unlike asf_demux.c
 * (which scans for the first audio-typed Stream Properties Object) this
 * doesn't scan for the stream -- files that don't follow the spec's
 * required layout aren't supported. */
