 * (shelf filters parameterized by Q the same way the Web Audio API's
 * BiquadFilterNode does, rather than the cookbook's alternate S/slope
 * parameter, so every band exposes the same freq/gain/Q trio regardless of
 * type). Applied to interleaved S16 stereo (or mono) PCM in the audio
 * output path, with independent filter state per channel so left/right
 * don't interfere with each other. Band layout (10 bands, ISO standard
 * center frequencies, first/last as shelves) matches a typical hardware

 * Filtered-difference headphone blend, not a stereo-width matrix and not a
 * room or HRTF model. Each channel keeps its
 * sample and adds k times the one-pole low-pass difference between the
 * channels (cutoff PEQ_CROSSFEED_FC_HZ): yL = xL + k * (lpR - lpL), and the
 * mirror for R. There is no interaural delay. A steady mono (L == R) signal
 * stays at unity gain because the same low-pass is removed and added back.
 *
 * At strength s the low-frequency cross coefficient is
 * k = s * PEQ_CROSSFEED_MAX_BLEND (direct 1 - k once the low-pass has
 * settled). High frequencies approach direct = 1, cross = 0. k <= 0.30, so
 * a full-scale hard-panned steady tone cannot exceed full scale from the
 * mix itself. A polarity reversal can still reach about 1 + 2k times full
 * scale while the low-pass holds the previous sample. The 1 ms limiter
 * attack does not cover those first samples. While crossfeed is active,
 * that same sample applies a stereo-linked gain so the frame peak does not
 * exceed the limiter ceiling (32760 in 16-bit, 8386560 in 24-bit) unless
 * the pre-crossfeed peak was already above it. In-range audio is not
 * attenuated. Strength 0 does not apply this gain, and the baseline limiter
 * is unchanged.
 *
 * Processing order for an active PCM buffer: per-channel preamp, per-channel
 * EQ, crossfeed (including that immediate gain), stereo width, limiter and
 * clamp. Mono buffers skip crossfeed and width. Strength 0 is an exact
 * no-op (the PCM fast path returns before the sample loop when preamp,
 * bands, width, and crossfeed are all idle). Bypass and native DoP skip
 * this stage entirely; DoP never enters peq_process(). Enabling only
 * crossfeed is enough to run the PCM stage.
 *
 * The stored default is 0 for new installs, reset, and profiles that omit
 * the key. PEQ_CROSSFEED_SUGGESTED is a conservative strength for a caller
 * that is explicitly turning the effect on. The audio thread ramps strength
 * over PEQ_CROSSFEED_RAMP_SEC. Going idle, bypass, or a non-stereo buffer
 * clears the low-pass memory. A sample-rate or PCM-format change, and a
 * PCM discontinuity noted by the audio thread, replace that memory with the
 * next input sample so the previous stream is not replayed and a steady
 * tone does not step. Continuous gapless PCM and ordinary block boundaries
 * do not. Toggling strength ramps. */
