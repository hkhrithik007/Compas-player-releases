/* Small path-cache-adjacent sidecar for gui.c's "Saved Servers" Subsonic
 * setup flow -- a multi-field, URL-keyed upsert record, unlike the plain
 * path lists path_cache.c holds (a server profile isn't a path) and
 * unlike remote_state.c's accumulate-by-play-count shape (this is a
 * replace-on-save profile, not a counter). Same on-disk discipline as
 * both of those: own mutex, lazy-loaded TSV file, atomic temp+rename+
 * fsync writes. url is the natural unique key (a real server only has
 * one) -- saving the same URL again replaces the existing row rather
 * than creating a duplicate. Password is stored in plain text, matching
 * this app's existing single-server settings.c field -- no new exposure,
 * there is no secret-storage mechanism to upgrade to here.
 *
 * Lives on the internal partition (/usr/data), not the SD card, so the
 * list still works with the card unmounted. settings.c also mirrors the
 * same profiles into the settings file for one-file backup. */
