/* Firmware update via the R1 Pro's own stock recovery mechanism -- confirmed
 * by reading the closed-source hiby_player binary's strings (references a
 * "%s/sd_0/%s.upt" path pattern and calls "/usr/bin/bootmode.sh Recovery")
 * and by inspecting /proc/mtd: kernel2/rootfs2 are a separate, smaller
 * partition pair (rootfs2 is roughly half rootfs's size), not a live A/B
 * twin of the running system -- they're a dedicated recovery image whose
 * whole job is to find a *.upt file (an ISO9660 image containing a chunked
 * kernel+rootfs payload, the exact same directory shape /etc/ota_bin's
 * network OTA scripts expect, just packaged as a mountable ISO instead of a
 * plain directory) on the SD card and flash it into the main kernel/rootfs
 * slot, then switch back and reboot again. Because that recovery partition
 * is untouched by this project's own repack, no custom flashing logic is
 * needed here at all -- only the same trigger the stock player uses. */
