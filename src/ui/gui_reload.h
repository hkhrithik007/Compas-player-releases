/* In-process "soft" UI reload: tears down every screen, style, and
 * plugin-contributed UI element and rebuilds them fresh in the same
 * process, without restarting it -- so a plugin.set_icon()/set_background_
 * color()/set_text_color() call can take full effect without requiring the
 * player to be killed and relaunched. Deliberately never touches
 * audio_init()'s playback state or any network/Bluetooth/D-Bus connection
 * (Wi-Fi, Subsonic, DLNA, AirPlay, Remote Control) -- only the LVGL screen
 * tree, style objects, the image cache, and the plugin Lua state get reset.
 * See gui_reload.c's own top comment for the exact teardown/rebuild
 * sequence and why each step is ordered the way it is. */

/* Synchronous -- runs the full teardown/rebuild sequence inline. Must ONLY
 * be called from the main loop (gui.c's while(1), via lv_timer_handler()),
 * never from inside a plugin_call(): it lua_close()s every plugin's
 * lua_State, and closing the state a currently-executing Lua call lives on
 * is undefined behavior. plugin.reload_ui() does NOT call this directly --
 * see gui_reload_request() below. */

/* Safe to call from anywhere, including from inside a plugin's own Lua

 * is back in gui.c's lv_timer_handler() loop. */
