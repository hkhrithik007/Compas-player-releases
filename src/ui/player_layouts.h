 *
 *  - BUILTIN_C: the hand-written layout in gui_player.c. Always registered
 *    under PLAYER_LAYOUT_ID_DEFAULT and always the fallback.
 *  - EXPORTED_C: a component exported to C by LVGL's UI Editor ("XML to C"),
 *    compiled in and registered with player_layouts_register_c().
 *  - XML_FILE: an LVGL XML file read at runtime, found by scanning the
 *    layout directories or registered by a plugin for the current session. */
